Thinking in Objects
===================

Preface
-------

In 2010, I was introduced to Ruby - my first properly Object Oriented (OO)
programming language. Before that, I had experience with scripting using shell
or Perl. Both of these I could wield procedurally. With shell scripts, there
isn't any other option anyway.

Initially, I wrote rudimentary bug fixes and small feature additions in a small
Rails project. A few months later, I'd taken over the development and
maintenance of the project. This allowed me to learn basic Ruby. I was still
writing procedural code, however. It worked, but it was far from pretty. The
project had been completed and I hadn't yet written a class of my own. I even
wrote decently complex a couple of script for analytics, using
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), in Ruby. And yet, I hadn't used the keyword
*class* anywhere. Again, the code worked perfectly well and churned out the
expected output and more.

There was a problem, however. Doing feature additions to any of this Ruby code
was hellish. Around this time I learnt what the *class* keyword in Ruby does
and what objects are. The problem was that I still couldn't figure out exactly
how I'd be able to write maintainable code by wielding the Object Oriented
Programming (OOP) methodology. After all, I'd read that that's one of the benefits of
doing OOP.
