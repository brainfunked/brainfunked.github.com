On Learning
===========

I can't dance. While I am mesmerised by the sheer grace and elegance of
classical (both Indian and Western) dance forms, the fascinations of 'modern'
dance forms do escape me. I found myself disinterested in the clamour from the
television as the presenter beckoned [Prabhu
Deva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhu_Deva) to the centre stage on a
[dance reality show](http://danceindiadance.in/didlittlemasters-videos/). I
did, however, observe with awe as he mimicked a hotshot young dancer's
movements with aplomb, with just a second's worth of observation.

A friend of mine, who possesses some skill with pencils, was once asked exactly
how he figures out which pencil to use in the situation at hand. All my friend
could say was, "I have no idea. I just know."

I don't think *knowing* something is the same as having *learnt* it. Learning,
to me, implies understanding and grasp upon the ability to put the
understanding to use, when called for.

Let me give you an example. It is possible for anyone to know the concepts or
rules behind [Composition][1]. One can develop a sense of composition by
practising upon these rules. Over time, with sufficient practice, the person
would be able to compose a photograph without having to think.

What's common with all three of the above examples is the lack of thinking on
part of the learner. From my experience, learning develops instincts. The
instincts I talk about are the brain's ability to react instantaneously to
stimuli.

In a physical context, for example sports, instincts might lead to purely
physical outcomes. In intellectual contexts, instincts should ideally be
followed by understanding of the knowledge. Development of instincts towards
solving an intellectual problem, in my observation, is generally an indicator
of the person in question having learnt.
